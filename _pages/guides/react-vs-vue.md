# Why two?

When Grove was initially developed in 2018, React was clearly the dominate UI framework in the market.  Angular was waning.  VueJS was up-and-coming but hadn't yet established itself as a major player.  As so many JS frameworks come and go at a rapid clip, the Grove team was worried VueJS may not have staying power.  We were wrong about that as of writing in 2020!

The team decided to embark upon building Grove in React *and* Vue to support both audiences.  We understood some customers may not want to be "stuck" with only one choice for a UI toolkit, as was the challenge with a legacy project that relied on AngularJS.  The middle tier developed would be swappable between either framework chosen.  And so Grove React and Grove Vue became a choice.

## Choose React when...

* The customer is already a React shop
* There is a lot of state to manage in the application
* There is customer concern about longevity of JS frameworks


## Choose Vue when...

* The customer is already a Vue shop
* The turnaround time on a project is tight - the Vue stack is a little faster to learn
* A versatile detail page is needed - a lot of widgets already exist to help display
