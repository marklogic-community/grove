# Guide to Working with the Grove React UI

This is a guide for developers working with the React UI provided by Grove. It includes step-by-step guides for customizing the detail page, search results, and navbar.

## DO THIS FIRST: Read up about React

Before modifying or extending the Grove React UI, you should be familiar with React. The official React website has a [brief and well-structured introduction to React concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Please work through it first. It will make everything else much easier to learn.

## Development Environment Setup

You may get errors in your code editor when opening React files if it does not have a JSX plugin. (You can add the "Javascript (Babel)" plugin to Sublime, for example.)

## Customization Recipes

The Grove React flavor can be customized to suit the needs of your application.  Follow these
recipes to make Grove your own.
